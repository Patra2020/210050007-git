# About the Repository
-This repository is based on hashing. 

-A **hash function** is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.There are various hashing functions and they are chosen such that _collision_, that is, same hash values for multiple input data  is avoided.

-One of the most common hash functions is the _polynomial accumulation_
  
   _h</sub>(x) = a<sub>o</sub> x + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + ... + a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup>_

## Importance of hashing :
It is one of the easiest methods for storing arbitary data so that _searching becomes very easy_, because now instead of _linear searching_ for our values in lists/ arrays , we can directly go the index of the array equal to the _hash value_ of our input data.

## Instructions to run the code
./test.sh [_string-name_]

where string-name should be the input string whose hash value is required.

## Solution of q1 of bash

alias sizeOfFiles="du -ah"

alias numberOfFiles="du -ah|wc -l"
